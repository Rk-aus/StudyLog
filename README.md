# Study log

## ~ Task 2 ~ Proposal
<T>I will implement a **study log** application. This application will 
allow *learners* to save their study as data.
I have used the term *learners* because anyone who is a *learner*
can use it.
<T>The objective of this application is to motivate
*learners* to learn more by visualizing how much they have studied 
over a certain period. Students who are struggling to maintain their
study habit could use this application as one of the incentives of studying. 
Another user example might be a
person who is interested in learning how to play the piano. Transforming the learner's
effort directly into a visual representation will boost the willingness to
learn. 


<T>This project is of interest to me because I am currently using a
study log application. I believe my study habit has drastically 
improved thanks to this application. Thus, I want to share 
this benefit by simplifying the current study log and adding new functionality. 
Another reason to choose this as my project is to figure out how to 
spark the studying motivation inside a student. Over my time as a student 
until now, I have witnessed countless students who do not enjoy studying at all. 
Their studying is **dead studying** because they do not fully appreciate the 
power of studying. We owe what we are today to studying. 
We are studying every day. In fact, we are studying every second. 
We are studying how to write when texting a friend. We are
studying video games when playing video games. We are studying 
how to breathe when we breathe. We have to study to improve at anything.
In our short life, we must ask ourselves. What do I want to study? 
I wish I can change as many student as possible so that they start the 
habit of **lively studying** through this study log.
